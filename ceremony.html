<pre>CEREMONY AT THE VEIL.

(At this point, a temple worker motions to the patrons, row by row, directing them to the various Veil segments. A worker stands at each segment to introduce the patron to "the Lord" who is on the other side of the Veil. The worker gives three distinct taps with the mallet.)

LORD: What is wanted?

WORKER: Adam, having been true and faithful in all things, desires further light and knowledge, by conversing with the Lord, through the Veil [for and in behalf of _____, who is dead].

LORD: Present him at the Veil, and his request shall be granted.

(The Lord gives the First Token of the Aaronic Priesthood through the opening in the Veil.)

LORD: What is that?

PATRON: The First Token of the Aaronic Priesthood.

LORD: Has it a name?

PATRON: It has.

LORD: Will you give it to me?

PATRON: I will, through the Veil. (The patron gives the New Name).

(The Lord gives the Second Token of the Aaronic Priesthood.)

LORD: What is that?

PATRON: The Second Token of the Aaronic Priesthood.

LORD: Has it a name?

PATRON: It has.

LORD: Will you give it to me?

PATRON: I will, through the Veil (The patron gives the first given name of the person for whom the temple work is being done).

(The Lord gives the First Token of the Melchizedeck Priesthood.)

LORD: What is that?

PATRON: The First Token of the Melchizedek Priesthood, or Sign of the Nail.

LORD: Has it a name?

PATRON: It has.

LORD: Will you give it to me?

PATRON: I will, through the Veil--the Son.

(The Lord gives the Second Token of the Melchizedek Priesthood.)

LORD: What is that?

PATRON: The Second Token of the Melchizedek Priesthood, the Patriarchal Grip, or Sure sign of the Nail.

LORD: Has it a name?

PATRON: It has.

LORD: Will you give it to me?

PATRON: I cannot. I have not yet received it. For this purpose I have come to converse with the Lord through the Veil.

LORD: You shall receive it through the Veil.

(The Lord and the patron, still holding the grip. The patron's left arm goes through the mark of the compass, and the Lord's left arm goes through the mark of the square.)

LORD: This is the name of the Token--"Health in the navel, marrow in the bones, strength in the loins and in the sinews, power in the Priesthood be upon me, and upon my posterity through all generations of time, and throughout all eternity."

LORD: What is that?

PATRON: The Second Token of the Melchizedek Priesthood, the Patriarchal Grip, or Sure Sign of the Nail.

LORD: Has it an name?

PATRON: It has.

LORD: Will you give it to me?

PATRON: I will - Health in the navel, marrow in the bones, strength in the loins and in the sinews, power in the Priesthood be upon me, and upon my posterity through all generations of time, and throughout all eternity.

LORD: That is correct.

(The Lord and patron break the ceremonial embrace, and the temple worker gives three taps with the mallet.)

LORD: What is wanted?

WORKER: Adam, having conversed with the Lord through the Veil, desires now to enter his presence.

LORD: Let him enter.

(The Veil is now parted and the Lord takes the patron by the right hand, and pulls him gently through the Veil into the Celestial Room.)
