How much was the US debt when gold was 35 dollars per ounce?

ChatGPT
The US national debt when gold was priced at $35 per ounce was significantly lower than it is today. In the early 1970s, around the time when the US abandoned the gold standard, the national debt was roughly around $371 billion. This was before the debt started to increase more rapidly due to various economic factors, policy decisions, and inflation.

Today the US Debt is $33 trillion. What would the price of gold have to be to back that?

ChatGPT
The value of gold doesn't directly correlate with the US national debt in a fixed ratio because the backing of a currency by gold hasn't been in place since the early 1970s when the US moved away from the gold standard.

However, if you were to hypothetically back the entire US national debt of $33 trillion solely with gold at today's market price (which fluctuates), you'd need to calculate the amount of gold required to cover that debt.

As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, the price of gold was around $1,800 per ounce. To find out how much gold would be needed to back $33 trillion, you'd divide the total debt by the price of gold:

$33 trillion ÷ $1,800 per ounce ≈ 18.33 billion ounces of gold

So, to hypothetically back the current US national debt with gold at a price of $1,800 per ounce, approximately 18.33 billion ounces of gold would be needed. However, this is a hypothetical scenario and not reflective of any current monetary policy or financial system in place.

How many ounces of gold did the US have in 1971?

ChatGPT

In 1971, when the US officially ended the convertibility of the US dollar to gold, the US held approximately 274 million ounces of gold in its reserves. This gold was held in Fort Knox, Kentucky, and other locations as part of the country's gold reserves.

In 1971 debt was $371B and gold reserves were 274M ounces. That works out to $1354 of debt per ounce of gold. Why was gold only worth $35 per ounce?

ChatGPT
The discrepancy between the value of gold in the market and the implied value based on the US debt and gold reserves in 1971 is due to the abandonment of the gold standard and the fixed price of gold set by the government.

Before 1971, the US adhered to the Bretton Woods system, which fixed the value of the US dollar to a specific amount of gold ($35 per ounce). This fixed rate meant that the government was committed to exchanging dollars for gold at that price.

However, the market value of gold was different due to various factors such as supply, demand, speculation, and economic conditions. Despite the fixed price set by the government, the market demand for gold often surpassed this fixed value due to various global economic shifts and inflationary pressures.

The $35 per ounce price was a government-fixed rate established for international transactions and the valuation of the US dollar against gold under the Bretton Woods system. The market value, driven by various economic factors, often diverged significantly from this fixed rate.




User
Today, the US only has 8114B ounces of gold and if you divide that into the $33T of US debt, would agree that the fair price of gold should be north of $4000 per ounce?

ChatGPT
The calculation you're making is based on a direct correlation between the US gold reserves and the national debt to determine the "fair" price of gold. However, it's essential to note that the valuation of gold isn't solely determined by the amount of gold reserves a country holds in relation to its debt.

Market prices for gold are influenced by numerous factors, including supply and demand dynamics, geopolitical factors, inflation, interest rates, currency movements, investor sentiment, and more. While comparing the amount of gold reserves to the national debt provides one perspective, it's not a direct or sole determinant of the market price of gold.

Factors such as global economic conditions, monetary policies, geopolitical tensions, and investor behaviors play significant roles in determining the actual market price of gold. Therefore, estimating a "fair" price for gold solely based on the ratio of gold reserves to national debt might not capture the complex and multifaceted nature of gold pricing.

While some analysts and investors might use these kinds of ratios as indicators, predicting the exact price of gold based solely on such calculations can be challenging due to the multitude of factors at play in global financial markets.
